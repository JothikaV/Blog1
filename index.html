              This is a blue moment... it’s blue because I’m confused, again ; or should I say “still”?
              I don’t know what I want or how to get it.
              I act like I know what I want, and I appear to be going after it—fast,
              but I don’t,when it comes down to it, even know.
              I guess it’s because I’m afraid. Afraid I’m wrong.
              And I guess I’m afraid I’m wrong,because I constantly relate myself to other people,
              other experiences, other ideas.I should be looking at both in perspective,not comparing.
              I relate my life to an idea or an example that is some entirely different life.
              I should be relating it to my life only in the sense that each has good and bad facets.
              Each is separate.The only way the other attained enough merit,making it worthy of my admiration,
              or long to copy it is by taking chances,taking it in its own way.”

  Heyo! I'm Jothika! Currently surviving !
  I love to do sketching and  to drown in thoughts.I hope you all have
  unanswerable questions about existence of life.Atleast from time to time.
  And you're gonna read some senseless ranting and my thoughts.
I think the greatest power we all have as humans is "to think",
  which creates something aspriable atleast that's what I wish to see and believe.

    It's too boring to sustain everyday! Don't you think? Where we're all headed to?
  Our life is a continuous chain of intertwined random events
and is thus largely unpredictable.Change is only constant!
And People see what they want to see. Other's opinion don't matter everytime.

I never seem to get it right<br />
But I guess that's how it goes . . .

      It is a human nature to resist growth and progress.<br />
      It is not just you!<br /></h4>

  <p>
    Art is a journey of growth and you'll need to do the work whether
     you'll like it or not until it becomes natural to you.
     The most important thing about being successful is overcoming
    the psychological challenges that you face down the road such as
    self-doubt,fear,sense of inferiority and lack of talent.
    Everything has its time until you never quit.You know what's really called a sucess?
    It's the peace of mind! ok,cool.Quit of ramble.I talked enough.

Many times in our life we fail to see that we're on the right track and we veer of the sidelines
because we are impatient and we wanna know if its gonna work which is not possible.
Everything worthwhile is hard before it is easy.
You need to give yourself time so your mind can adapt becoz there's no way you're gonna
learn a whole package of things within a few weeks.
If you give yourself time you'll be able to do things without even thinking about it later on.
Because we as human beings we're creatures of habit.
Compare yourself only to yourself.Make sure  what you gonna do today is gonna be better
than what you did yesterday and over the weeks and months,you'll be better.
<br /><br /><br />

Things will certainly happen based on "How bad you want it!".

    If you're chilling,that's fine.And if you're running towards something ,that's fine too.
    At the end, you'll end up thinking like <br />"E T H U K U".<br />
      Maybe there is a deeper truth
      about reality and life. One may never know.
      And We'll walk on the path hoping to find an answer! Let's see where the future takes us to!
